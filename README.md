## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- jQuery

### What I learned

I learnt about the sessionStorage to store the data for a session to pass between different pages using javaScript.

```js
sessionStorage.setItem("rating", rating);
```

### Continued development

I'm willing to build an e-commerce website. So this rating component can be useful.

### Useful resources
